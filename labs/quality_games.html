# Quality Lab

* In your group (3-4) identify three 'good' common games between the group.
* Discuss and write out individually based on your discussion about the quality factors this game portrays and justify your decision.
* Turn this in via github/canvas and quality_lab.md inside your class repo.
* You have 15 minutes to discuss and 10 minutes to start and take your notes. Finish on your own time.
