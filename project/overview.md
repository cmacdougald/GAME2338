# Part One: Game Selection

Using a criteria determined by the team, pick a common game you will all play and test using methods taught in the course. Turn in a short paper describing the game and why your team choose this game. Recommendation is to use the [game review template](/assignments/gamereviewtemplate.md) to start and modify accordingly.

# Part Two: Test Plan

Use the test plan outline to develop a test plan for your selected game. Your test plan should include schedule testing events such as when the Test Plan, Test Cases and Test Report will be completed and scheduled testing dates.

# Part Three: Test Cases

After completing your test plan, use the test case template and write 8-10 test cases to validate the functionality of your selected game. You can write more test cases on your game.

# Part Four: Test Report

On scheduled testing dates, run your written test cases. Use the Test Report outline to produce a test report for your selected game. Test Report should include any defects found during testing.
