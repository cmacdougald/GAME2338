# Definitions

* Smoke Testing
  * “Build Verification Testing”, is a type of software testing that comprises of a non-exhaustive set of tests that aim at ensuring that the most important functions work. The result of this testing is used to decide if a build is stable enough to proceed with further testing. It can also be used to decide whether to announce a production release or to revert. The term ‘smoke testing’, it is said, came to software testing from a similar type of hardware testing, in which the device passed the test if it did not catch fire (or smoked) the first time it was turned on.
  
* Functional Testing
  * is a type of software testing that validates the software system against the functional requirements/specifications. The purpose of Functional tests is to test each function of the software application, by providing appropriate input, verifying the output against the Functional requirements.

* Unit Testing
  * also known as COMPONENT TESTING,  is a level of software testing where individual units / components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed.

# Benefits

* uncovers problems early
* increases confidence in changing / maintaining code
* Codes is more reusable
* Development is faster
* cost of fixing a defect detected during testing is lesser in comparison to that of defects detected at higher levels

---

# Balance

* Usually depends on code coverage and level of quality requirements
   

---

# Getting Started

* Language Specific
* Tool Selection
* Planning, Designing, and Development
* Executing Test Cases and Build your reports
* Maintaining previous test cases

---
   
# Scope
      
* What are you actually testing and what do you want to accomplish?

# Tool Selection
      
* Obvious research what tools and compare/contrast
      
---
   
# Planning, Designing, and Development

* Proof of Concept
* Prototype
* Rigging
* Test Templates
* Documentation, Documentation, Documentation!

# Executing Test Cases and Build your reports

* Run in your CI/CD pipeline
* Important to run failures
* Tests should fail fast
* Reports should be easy to read and understand results
* Results should be global to company and/or teams

# Maintaining previous test cases

* Tests require Tender, Love, and Care (TLC)
