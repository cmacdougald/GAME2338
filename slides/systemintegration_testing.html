* System Testing
  * While developing a software or application product, it is tested at the final stage as a whole by combining all the product modules and this is called as System Testing. The primary aim of conducting this test is that it must fulfill the customer/user requirement specification. It is also called as an end-to-end test, as is performed at the end of the development. This testing does not depend on system implementation; in simple words, the system tester doesn’t know which technique among procedural and object-oriented is implemented.

# Systems Testing
      
* Covers the following:
  * Testing the fully integrated applications including external peripherals in order to check how components interact with one another and with the system as a whole. This is also called End to End testing scenario.
  * Verify thorough testing of every input in the application to check for desired outputs.
  * Testing of the user’s experience with the application.

# Definitions
      
* Integration Testing
  * This testing is the collection of the modules of the software, where the relationship and the interfaces between the different components are also tested. It needs coordination between the project level activities of integrating the constituent components together at a time.
  * The integration and integration testing must adhere to a building plan for the defined integration and identification of the bug in the early stages.

# Integration Testing Types

* Big Bang Approach – Testing is done through coupling.
* Bottom-Up Approach – Testing is done in the method of low to high levels.
* Top-Down Approach – Testing is done from higher to lower levels.
* Hybrid Approach – Bottom-Up and Top-Down Approaches are combined.

# Integration Testing Types

* Big Bang Approach
  * Convenient for small applications
  * Easy detection of faulty bugs
* Bottom-Up Approach
  * Individual module development
  * Errors are fixed at the same level and time
  * Less consumption of time.
* Top-Down Approach
  * Errors are smoothly detected
  * Crucial modules are first prioritized
* Hybrid Approach
  * Used to solve the complexities of huge and complicated software

# Best Practices/ Guidelines for Integration Testing

* First, determine the Integration Test Strategy that could be adopted and later prepare the test cases and test data accordingly.
* Study the Architecture design of the Application and identify the Critical Modules. These need to be tested on priority.
* Obtain the interface designs from the Architectural team and create test cases to verify all of the interfaces in detail. Interface to database/external hardware/software application must be tested in detail.
* After the test cases, it’s the test data which plays the critical role.
* Always have the mock data prepared, prior to executing. Do not select test data while executing the test cases.
