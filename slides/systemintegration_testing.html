# Definitions

* System Testing
  * While developing a software or application product, it is tested at the final stage as a whole by combining all the product modules and this is called as System Testing. The primary aim of conducting this test is that it must fulfill the customer/user requirement specification. It is also called as an end-to-end test, as is performed at the end of the development. This testing does not depend on system implementation; in simple words, the system tester doesnâ€™t know which technique among procedural and object-oriented is implemented.
  
* Integration Testing
  * This testing is the collection of the modules of the software, where the relationship and the interfaces between the different components are also tested. It needs coordination between the project level activities of integrating the constituent components together at a time.
  * The integration and integration testing must adhere to a building plan for the defined integration and identification of the bug in the early stages.

# Definitions
      
* Unit Testing
  * also known as COMPONENT TESTING,  is a level of software testing where individual units / components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed.

# Benefits

* uncovers problems early
* increases confidence in changing / maintaining code
* Codes is more reusable
* Development is faster
* cost of fixing a defect detected during testing is lesser in comparison to that of defects detected at higher levels

---

# Balance

* Usually depends on code coverage and level of quality requirements
   

---

# Getting Started

* Language Specific
* Tool Selection
* Planning, Designing, and Development
* Executing Test Cases and Build your reports
* Maintaining previous test cases

---
   
# Scope
      
* What are you actually testing and what do you want to accomplish?

# Tool Selection
      
* Obvious research what tools and compare/contrast
      
---
   
# Planning, Designing, and Development

* Proof of Concept
* Prototype
* Rigging
* Test Templates
* Documentation, Documentation, Documentation!
      
---

# Executing Test Cases and Build your reports

* Run in your CI/CD pipeline
* Important to run failures
* Tests should fail fast
* Reports should be easy to read and understand results
* Results should be global to company and/or teams

# Maintaining previous test cases

* Tests require Tender, Love, and Care (TLC)
